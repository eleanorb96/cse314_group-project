# Getting started with the Nutritionix CSE314 API

_Welcome to the API! This API allows you to pull nutritional data from various food sources
and compare products with each other, such as fat content and calories._

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **ENSURE** that you have followed every instruction in the [installation](installation.md) page. You must have the required dependencies
   to run this API.

2. Run the main API python file and connect to the given link.

3. You will be on a localhost site that reads "Compare Your Favorite Fast Food Meals. You can choose two restaurants
   to compare. For example, choosing McDonalds and Wendy's will bring up an additional box where you can choose individual
   items (e.g. Big Mac and Frosty) and compare their nutritional values.

4. Below will be a pie chart that shows the amount of calories consumed and calories remaining from the daily
   value of calories of the average person (2000 calories).

5. Additionally, there will be a nutrition fact column that shows the amount of total calories and fats as well as what percentage of the daily value it covers.

**Have fun with the API!**
