# Examples on using this API

This API is very simple to use. Here are some examples to help you get going.

## Comparing item(s) from the same restaurant

Choose either the left or right box and select a restaurant. Then, select a food item.

- For example, choosing "McDonalds" and then "Quarter Pounder with Cheese Bacon" will display a graph
  with the number of calories.
- If you wish to compare more than one item, then you may choose as many items as you'd like. The graph
  displayed will show all of the items chosen, comparing their calories through a bar graph.

## Comparing two or more items from different restaurants

Choose a restaurant in the left box, and then choose a different restaurant you would like to compare it to in the right box. Then, select food item(s) for both.

- For example, choosing "McDonalds" for the left box and "Wendy's" for the right box will allow you to compare their
  food items with each other. It will display the calories of their food items in a bar graph, allowing for an easy visualization as to which food item contains more calories or fat content.
