# Examples on using this API

This API is very simple to use. Here are some examples to help you get going.

## Comparing item(s) from the same restaurant

Choose either the left or right box and select a restaurant. Then, select a food item.

- For example, choosing "McDonalds" and then "Quarter Pounder with Cheese Bacon" will display a nutritional chart
  with information shown in [Getting-Started](getting-started.md).
- If you wish to compare more than one item, then you may choose as many items as you'd like. The nutritional chart
  will display the information by adding up the nutritional content from all of the selected items.

## Comparing two or more items from different restaurants

Choose a restaurant in the left box, and then choose a different restaurant you would like to compare it to in the right box. Then, select food item(s) for both.

- For example, choosing "McDonalds" for the left box and "Wendy's" for the right box will allow you to compare their
  food items with each other. It will display a nutritional chart with their nutritional info shown in the link above.
- Additionally, the bar graph at the bottom will display their calorie differences and more. More information about this
  is shown in [Getting-Started](getting-started.md).
- If more than one food item is chosen by either of the restaurants, then all of their nutritional values will be added
  up.
- For example, if I chose a Whopper Jr (310 cal) and Double Cheeseburger (390 cal) for Burger King and an Apple Fritter
  (510 cal) for McDonalds, we would be comparing a total of 700 cal for Burger King and 510 cal for McDonalds.
