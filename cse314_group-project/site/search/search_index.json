Here are some examples to help you get going. Comparing item(s) from the same restaurant Choose either the left or right box and select a restaurant. Then, select a food item. For example, choosing \"McDonalds\" and then \"Quarter Pounder with Cheese Bacon\" will display a nutritional chart with information shown in Getting-Started . If you wish to compare more than one item, then you may choose as many items as you'd like. The nutritional chart will display the information by adding up the nutritional content from all of the selected items. Comparing two or more items from different restaurants Choose a restaurant in the left box, and then choose a different restaurant you would like to compare it to in the right box. Then, select food item(s) for both. For example, choosing \"McDonalds\" for the left box and \"Wendy's\" for the right box will allow you to compare their food items with each other. It will display a nutritional chart with their nutritional info shown in the link above. Additionally, the bar graph at the bottom will display their calorie differences and more. More information about this is shown in Getting-Started . If more than one food item is chosen by either of the restaurants, then all of their nutritional values will be added up. For example, if I chose a Whopper Jr (310 cal) and Double Cheeseburger (390 cal) for Burger King and an Apple Fritter (510 cal) for McDonalds, we would be comparing a total of 700 cal for Burger King and 510 cal for McDonalds.","title":"Examples"},{"location":"examples/#examples-on-using-this-api","text":"This API is very simple to use.

This API allows you to pull nutritional data from various food sources and compare products with each other, such as fat content and calories. To get started, follow these steps: ENSURE that you have followed every instruction in the installation page. You must have the required dependencies to run this API. Run the main API python file and connect to the given link. With this, you will be on a localhost site that reads \"Compare Your Favorite Fast Food Meals\". You can choose two restaurants to compare. For example, choosing McDonalds and Wendy's will bring up an additional box where you can choose individual items (e.g. Big Mac and Frosty) and compare their nutritional values. Below will be a nutrition fact section that will list and compare the following: Total Calories Total Fat Saturated Fat Trans Fat Cholestrol Sodium Total Carbohydrate Dietary Fiber Sugars Protein Vitamin A Vitamin C Calcium Iron The food items will be supplied with the amount of all of the above as well as the percentage of daily recommended intake the amount takes up. If there is more than one item from the same restaurant, all of the items' nutritional values will be added up. Additionally, there will be a \"Nutrition Differences\" bar graph that compares the following between the items in the two compared restaurants: Calorie Difference Calories from Fat Difference Calories from Carbs Difference Calories from Protein Difference With this, you can easily tell which food item(s) from the two restaurants has better nutritional content and more.
