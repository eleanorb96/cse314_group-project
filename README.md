## Welcome to our Nutrition Comparison Helper

With the dashboard we have created, you can compare the nutritional values of your favorite meals at 10 of the top fast food restaurants in the United States. Complete with visualization of the meal's contents, a nutrition table/label, and comparisons between the meals, you can make a more informed decision about the food you are eating. 

Please consult our "Getting Started" guide and "Installation" guide to begin!

Note: Occasionally, the database does not always load porperly on the initial run of the code. If this occurs, refresh the page and let the dashboard update.
