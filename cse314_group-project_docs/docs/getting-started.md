# Getting started with the Nutritionix CSE314 API

_Welcome to the API! This API allows you to pull nutritional data from various food sources
and compare products with each other, such as fat content and calories._

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **ENSURE** that you have followed every instruction in the [installation](installation.md) page. You must have the required dependencies
   to run this API.

2. Run the main API python file and connect to the given link.

With this, you will be on a localhost site that reads "Compare Your Favorite Fast Food Meals". You can choose two restaurants to compare. For example, choosing McDonalds and Wendy's will bring up an additional box where you can choose individual items (e.g. Big Mac and Frosty) and compare their nutritional values.

Below will be a nutrition fact section that will list and compare the following:

- Total Calories
- Total Fat
- Saturated Fat
- Trans Fat
- Cholestrol
- Sodium
- Total Carbohydrate
- Dietary Fiber
- Sugars
- Protein
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin C
- Calcium
- Iron

The food items will be supplied with the amount of all of the above as well as the percentage of daily recommended
intake the amount takes up. If there is more than one item from the same restaurant, all of the items' nutritional
values will be added up.

Additionally, there will be a "Nutrition Differences" bar graph that compares the following between the items
in the two compared restaurants:

- Calorie Difference
- Calories from Fat Difference
- Calories from Carbs Difference
- Calories from Protein Difference

With this, you can easily tell which food item(s) from the two restaurants has better nutritional content and more.

**Have fun with the API!**
